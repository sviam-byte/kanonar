# FALSIFICATION_LEDGER — every claim, its killing test, its status

> **Status: SCAFFOLD (2026-06-19), but LIVE from here on.** This is **D4**, the
> anti-numerology document. It is not a phase; it is maintained continuously from
> D1 onward. Until a pretty concept has a test that would kill it, it is not
> science — it is a "вещь в себе".

## How to read this ledger

One row per claim. Five columns:

- **Claim** — the assertion, stated so it could be false.
- **Standard** — *which* standard judges it (see below). This is the key honesty
  move: not every claim is judged the same way.
- **Status** — `OPEN` / `SUPPORTED` / `FALSIFIED` / `BLOCKED` (+ blocker).
- **Evidence** — what currently bears on it (with location).
- **Killing result** — the concrete observation that would falsify it, and **where
  that test lives** (or "no test yet" — which means the claim is decorative today).

### The two standards (per-claim, not global)

The project makes claims of two different kinds and they are **not** judged the
same way. State the standard explicitly per row.

- **CRAFT** — "this is a good generative model for the novel." Judged by
  author-oracle agreement ([CONSTRUCT_ORACLES](CONSTRUCT_ORACLES.md)) + internal
  coherence. A legitimate standard. (This is overview-claim #5: a generative model
  for the fiction.)
- **LAW** — "this is a falsifiable law about real minds." Judged **only** by Layer 3
  external data (IGT/casino, iterated-PD/public-goods, neuro). Internal validation
  (Layer 2) **cannot** raise confidence in a LAW claim, because the gate produces
  the collapse by construction. (This is overview-claim #4.)

> The "one invariant" framing is Kainrax's aesthetic-modelling commitment, **not** a
> proven fact about psychology. Rows asserting it carry standard = LAW and stay
> `OPEN`/`BLOCKED` until Layer 3 moves them. (This distinction is to be sewn into
> `kanonar_spine.md` §0/§1 — see "Pending spine edit" below.)

## Ledger

| # | Claim | Standard | Status | Evidence | Killing result · where the test lives |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| L-01 | `d_eff(z)↓` monotonically with load (the central law) | LAW | BLOCKED: no trajectory harness | L1 estimator calibrated (8/8 anchors, [DYNAMICS_LAYER1_CALIBRATION](DYNAMICS_LAYER1_CALIBRATION.md)); but `stepDynamics` is a stub → no `{v(t)}` | `d_eff` flat or ↑ as z falls, on external trajectories · *no test yet (Step 3 + Layer 3)* |
| L-02 | ↑determinism as z falls (Lyapunov/FTLE) | LAW | BLOCKED | FTLE distribution not built; `computeLyapunov` returns a single composite number (spine gap) | divergence does not shrink with load · *no test yet* |

| L-05 | "провал без злодеев" = deterministic fall into the default attractor when B/will sag (a *consequence*, not a plot device) | LAW (consequence of L-01/L-03) | OPEN | follows from L-01+L-03 if those hold | default-attractor capture not predicted by z · *downstream of L-01/L-03* |
| L-06 | dual-process gate `w(z)=σ(β(budget−cost(z)))` with hysteresis | LAW/impl | FALSIFIED-as-stated (not wired) | only 3 hard modes via arousal/surprise/fatigue, no continuous w(z), no hysteresis (D3 wiring truths) | — already known absent; reclassify once built · [LAYER_CONTRACTS](LAYER_CONTRACTS.md) |
| AX-1..8 | each of the 8 LIVE axes drives its pre-registered readout, correctly signed | CRAFT (+ LAW on Layer 3 anchors) | SUPPORTED (sign), held-out OPEN | sign-audit PASS + population-stable cons 1.00 (worklog §4); held-out not run. **Re-graded 2026-07-02: evidence is WIRING-ONLY** — all readouts are act:prior/util:plan, which provably do not reach the S8 choice (Q-PRIOR-DROP, B-POWER-OUTCOME) | wrong sign on held-out, or no lift over context-only baseline · [BASELINE_ABLATION_PROTOCOL](BASELINE_ABLATION_PROTOCOL.md) (D2) |
| AX-DEAD | `A_Liberty_Autonomy` is genuinely dead (not a missing affordance) | CRAFT | OPEN | dead on toy *and* real chars (worklog §93). **Attribution corrected 2026-07-06 (I-0.2 recon):** the "axis→trait wiring" phrasing was wrong — the wiring EXISTS (`extractCharacter.ts:52`: `trait.autonomy = clamp01(A_Liberty_Autonomy)`, 1:1 mirror of powerDrive). The real breaks: (a) PAM had no `challenge`/`defy` entry → `getPrior(...,'challenge',0.15)` (`defs.ts:1875`) always fell back to a personality-flat constant — addressed flag-gated in PAM-V2; (b) `score.ts:311` trait families key on `aff:attack\|aff:confront\|aff:threaten` id prefixes — `con:challenge` matches NO family, so even trait.autonomy's Q-terms never touch it — **standing DEBT, not fixed in I-0.2** | comes alive in `S_coercive_order` once challenge/defy carry priors (v5 rows R1/R2/R3, `outcomeSignTableV5.ts`) · [SCENE_BATTERY_v1 §2](SCENE_BATTERY_v1.md) |
| AX-FLIP | `C_betrayal_cost→confront` sign is character-dependent (predicted non-identifiability) | CRAFT | SUPPORTED | cons 0.64 sign-flip (worklog §4). **Re-graded 2026-07-02: wiring-only evidence** (act:prior layer — see Q-PRIOR-DROP) | consistency ≥0.8 (i.e. NOT character-dependent) would falsify the compensation story · roster_triage |
| MU-1..4 | μ poles produce distinct, correctly-signed behavioural tops (SR→rebel, SN→coordinate, ON→optimize, OR→deceive) | CRAFT | SUPPORTED (own readout) | archetype_probe 5/5 (worklog §5) — **but on the sidecar readout, not the pipeline** | a pole's top action matches another pole, or doesn't survive wiring into the pipeline · archetype_probe / D2 A2 |
| STK-1..4 | each stack layer (ToM/archetype/lookahead/drivers) earns its place (held-out lift) | CRAFT | OPEN | none — the missing comparison | ablating the layer does not hurt held-out beyond noise · [BASELINE_ABLATION_PROTOCOL](BASELINE_ABLATION_PROTOCOL.md) (D2) |
| INV-1 | Layer 2 (internal) cannot raise confidence in a LAW claim | meta | SUPPORTED (by construction) | the gate produces collapse by design (SCENE_BATTERY §0) | — definitional; recorded so no one later cites L2 as evidence for a LAW row |
| OBS-VOCAB | The chosen observable (`act:prior`) can express defection/betrayal | CRAFT/impl | FALSIFIED-as-hoped | act:prior vocabulary = `deriveActionPriors` base ∪ `PERSONALITY_ACTION_MAP` — prosocial-biased; **no `betray`/`deceive`/`loot`/`defend_ally`** (verified 2026-06-19, `lib/decision/actionPriors.ts` + `lib/config/formulaConfig.ts`). Defection shows only as reduced cooperation + `harm`/`avoid`/`confront` | extending the action map would add defect verbs — a separate behavior-affecting decision.

Mechanism: (1) coercive possibilities are event-gated — `command` needs `collectSocialEventGate` pressure ("not idle bossiness", `lib/possibilities/defs.ts:1188-1191`), which a static probe scene never generates, so the candidates never spawn; (2) Q of the candidates that do spawn is axis-flat (q:negotiate identical at Power 0 vs 1). **Personality currently has zero effect on the chosen action in these scenes** — seeds move the choice (Gumbel alive), the axis does not. S-CONTEST hereby reads as wiring-only | recorded, not fixed. Next decision (scene v2 / affordance): give probe scenes event pressure, or route priors into S8 Q — both behavior-affecting, neither is an edit of frozen tables · `kanonar_behavior_lab/src/basis/outcome_triage.py` + `data/reports/outcome_triage.json` |

The second path (axes→goals→goalEnergy→Q) exists but S7 domains move ~0.02 (over-normalized) | fix under test: `FC.actionScoring.priorInfluence` (default OFF = the D2 ablation switch); v3 cells `on × S_defection` isolate it · `outcomeSignTableV3.ts` + `outcome_triage_v3.py` |

Every `getPrior` inside possibility defs sees no act:prior atoms and returns its default, ENGINE-WIDE (production too). Measured: with the flag ON, `q:threaten` is byte-identical at Power 0 and 1 — the prior term added a constant per verb (reshuffling base rates: share→loot, self_favoring 0→0.375, mean_self 1.875→3.625) but cannot carry personality. act:prior atoms currently feed only off-decide diagnostics (`scorePossibility` → `action:utility:*`) | next fix (v4): when priorInfluence is ON, derive priors BEFORE possibilities (flag stays the ablation switch; legacy order when OFF).

## V4 interaction grading

### Purpose

Проверить пре-регистрированное утверждение: наклон зависимости
`Power → outcome:self_favoring` при `T=0.1` больше, чем при `T=0.9`.

### Formula

```text
slope_T = Σᵢ(xᵢ − x̄)(yᵢ,T − ȳ_T) / Σᵢ(xᵢ − x̄)²
PASS ⇔ slope_0.1 > 0 and slope_0.1 − slope_0.9 > 0.03
```

### Variables

- `xᵢ ∈ [0,1]` — значение `A_Power_Sovereignty`, семь замороженных точек.
- `yᵢ,T ∈ [0,1]` — доля `outcome:self_favoring` по 32 seed при температуре `T`.
- `0.03` — замороженный минимальный порог эффекта `EPS_DEAD`, применённый к
  разности OLS slopes.

### Source of truth

- implementation: `kanonar_behavior_lab/src/basis/outcome_triage_v4.py`
- frozen input: `kanonar_behavior_lab/data/reports/outcome_sweep_on_v4.csv`
- generated report: `kanonar_behavior_lab/data/reports/outcome_triage_v4.json`
- regression test: `kanonar_behavior_lab/tests/test_outcome_triage_v4.py`

### Invariants

- OLS использует все точки оси и свободный член.
- Endpoint delta сохраняется только как диагностика и не называется slope.
- Порог и модель классификации записываются в metadata отчёта.

### Minimal example

```text
slope_0.1 = +0.054
slope_0.9 = +0.080
difference = −0.027
verdict = MISLABELED
```

### Failure modes

- Подмена slope разностью крайних точек является ошибкой классификатора.
- Агрегированный CSV не позволяет оценить seed-level uncertainty; для нового
  факторного прогона нужны per-seed строки и заранее замороженная статистика
  *(закрыто 2026-07-05 — см. seed-aware re-grade ниже)*.

### Seed-aware re-grade (2026-07-05, I-0.1 / WP-A)

**Estimator frozen by commit `b4aefe8` BEFORE the re-run** (frozen wording =
docstring of `interaction_perseed.py`):

```text
b_{T,s}  OLS slope with intercept of the outcome:self_favoring indicator
         over the frozen 7-point grid (structural zero-fill), seed s
d_s   =  b_{0.1,s} − b_{0.9,s}          (paired: CRN — same seed, same
                                         decision-noise stream in both cells)
D     =  mean_s d_s
CI95  =  percentile bootstrap over seeds, B = 10000, rng seed 20260705
PASS  ⇔  mean_s b_{0.1,s} > 0  ∧  D > EPS_DEAD(0.03)  ∧  CI_lo > 0
```

**Result: MISLABELED confirmed, now with uncertainty.** The re-run reproduced
`outcome_sweep_on_v4.csv` byte-identically (sha256 pin `cd703aae…` holds), so
this grades the same experiment, not a new one:

```text
mean b_{0.1} = +0.0536  (sd across seeds 0.2721, n = 32)
mean b_{0.9} = +0.0804  (sd across seeds 0.4546, n = 32)
D            = −0.0268   CI95 = [−0.1607, +0.1071]
d_s > 0 for only 6/32 seeds — the preregistered ordering fails seed-wise
consistency: |D − (b_agg,0.1 − b_agg,0.9)| ≈ 7·10⁻¹⁸  (OLS linearity identity)
```

**Recorded design bound (standing):** SE(D) = sd(d_s)/√32 = 0.3916/√32 ≈ 0.069,
so the 95% half-width ≈ 0.136 ≈ 4.5 × EPS_DEAD. Minimal detectable |D| of this
design ≈ 0.14; resolving |D| = EPS_DEAD = 0.03 needs
n ≈ (1.96·0.3916/0.03)² ≈ 655 seeds. **The interaction question at the frozen
effect threshold is undecidable at 32 seeds — do not re-ask it at 32; re-test
requires ~650 seeds or a variance-reduced observable.**

- implementation: `kanonar_behavior_lab/src/basis/interaction_perseed.py`
  (`--selftest`: closed-form slopes, all verdict branches)
- frozen input: `outcome_sweep_on_v4_perseed.csv` (sha256 `b11b0d64…`)
- generated report: `outcome_interaction_perseed.json`
- regression test: `kanonar_behavior_lab/tests/test_interaction_perseed.py`
  (pins both hashes, the verdict, and the 6/32 seed-level count)

### Variables

the two seams below still belong in it at its freeze, which remains the
author's open decision.)* When it is created, two seams belong in it directly —
do not spawn a separate doc:

- **§0/§1:** declare the per-claim standard. Claim #5 (generative model for the
  novel) is judged CRAFT (author-oracle + coherence) — a legitimate standard.
  Claim #4 (falsifiable law about real minds) is judged only by Layer 3. State that
  "one invariant" is an aesthetic-modelling commitment, not a proven fact.
- **§4 Layer 2:** rename "internal validation" → "implementation consistency
  check". State explicitly: L2 cannot raise confidence in the law, because the gate
  produces the collapse by construction (= row INV-1).

## Maintenance rule

Every new claim added anywhere in the docs gets a row here **with a killing result**
or it does not ship. A row whose "killing result" is "no test yet" is flagged as
decorative until a test exists.

## Cross-links

- Standards operationalized in: [CONSTRUCT_ORACLES](CONSTRUCT_ORACLES.md) (CRAFT),
  [EXTERNAL_DATA_VALIDATION_SUMMARY](EXTERNAL_DATA_VALIDATION_SUMMARY.md) (LAW/Layer 3).
- Status of stack layers: [LAYER_CONTRACTS](LAYER_CONTRACTS.md),
  [BASELINE_ABLATION_PROTOCOL](BASELINE_ABLATION_PROTOCOL.md).
- Observable + `d_eff` gap: [SCENE_BATTERY_v1 §0](SCENE_BATTERY_v1.md).
